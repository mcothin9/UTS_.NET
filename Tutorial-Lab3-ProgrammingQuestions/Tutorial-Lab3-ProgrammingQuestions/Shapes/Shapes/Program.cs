﻿using System;
/*Write a program to define a Shape class. The Shape class will be used to create two objects: Circle and Rectangle, 
and calculate their areas.Shape class should have constructors to initialize circle(with radius) and rectangle(with height and width).

 There should be two methods to calculate the area of circle and rectangle.
 The Shape objects should be created in the class containing the main() method.Please use the below class diagram :
 
 -------------------------------
 | Shape                      |
 -------------------------------
 | - height: double			  |
 | - width: double			  |
 | - radius : double	      |
 | - pi : double (const)      |
 -------------------------------
 | + Shape(ht, wd)			   |
 | + Shape(rad)                |
 | + rectangleArea():double    |
 | + circleArea()::double      |
 | + Display(shapetype)        |
 -------------------------------
 The object should be initialized using respective constructors
 
 Example:
Radius of circle is: 4.0
Height and Width of rectangle is: 5.0 ,4.0
Area of Circle is: 50.26548245743669
Area of Rectangle is: 20.0

Hint:
1. For area of circle use pi =3.142, Area = PI * radius * radius
2. Area of rectangle = height * width
3. Check the main method before creating the shape class

/*
The program should produce the following result
  Test case 1:
  Initialize the circle with radius: 4
  Initialize the rectangle with ht and wd: 5, 4
  
  Expected output:
  Radius of circle is: 4.0
  Height and Width of rectangle is: 5.0 ,4.0
  Area of Circle is: 50.26548245743669
  Area of Rectangle is: 20.0

  Test case 2:
  Initialize the circle with radius: 10
  Initialize the rectangle with ht and wd: 15, 5
  Note the result
